Machine Learning Engineer,MobSquad,"About MobsquadWe are a well-funded, hyper-growth, scale-up looking for an experienced Machine Learning Engineer. If you've ever dreamed of working with a top tier technology company scale-up, on leading edge technologies, backed by the very best venture capitalists in the world, then this is your chance.Some details about MobSquad:MobSquad solves the significant and growing technology talent shortage faced by US-based start-ups and scale-ups by enabling its clients to quickly have a turnkey ""virtual"" Canadian subsidiary. MobSquad ensures technology professionals with US work visa challenges remain working with their current company, but nearshore from Canada. This is accomplished via MobSquad's unique partnership with the Canadian Government, enabling work visas to be issued for technology professionals and their respective families within four to six weeks, and Canadian permanent residency within six to eight months. Additionally, MobSquad has unfettered access to top-tier global technology talent which it relocates to Canada and pairs with American as well as Canadian clients on an exclusive, long-term basis, helping firms not only retain their existing world-class technology talent base, but grow it substantially. We're a Certified B corporation, and have made numerous contributions to charitable organizations, as well as a financial commitment to the Upside Foundation. We believe we are playing a key role in enhancing Canada's innovation economy, and have received financial support from the Government of Canada, Province of Alberta, Province of Nova Scotia, and City of Calgary, to support this ambition. For our workplace culture, we were recognized as the 3rd best place to work in Canada (for a small company) in 2020, as well as recognized specifically for being one of the best workplaces nationally for: inclusion; mental wellness; giving back; youth; and technology.

Data Scientist/Analyst,IQ Hunt Ltd.,"The Hub Program at Client is modernizing its data reporting by improving user experience and introducing internal efficiencies, including the automation of indicator methodology calculations.Our Client's disclosures of health information are made at the highest degree of anonymity possible while still meeting the research and/or analytical purposes. Client publicly releases aggregated data in a manner designed to minimize any risk of re-identification and residual disclosure.Client is endeavouring to automate complex statistical disclosure controls (e.g. small cell-size suppression) to reduce the burden of their manual application, thereby introducing internal efficiencies and improve the timeliness of our reporting.ServicesAssess three statistical disclosure control tools (G-Confid, Tau-Argus and sdcTable) for their ability to meet Client's need to automate statistical disclosure control techniques (e.g. primary and complementary cell suppressions, rounding, etc) for a variety of multi-dimensional, linked and hierarchical aggregate data tables sourcing clinical databases and survey data, with the goal of minimizing disclosure risk while maximizing information utility. Conduct a proof of concept demonstrating the tools' features and capabilities using a variety of aggregate Client data tables, while highlighting how each of the tools could fit into operational data production processes.Write a report summarizing the findings and recommend which among these tools would best meet Client needs. Create plain-language documentation to support the application of preferred disclosure control techniques to aggregate data sets using the recommended tool. Knowledge transfer to support ongoing in-house operational application of the preferred statistical disclosure control techniques for future data releases.Skill or Knowledge Skill Required Skill Level *(Intermediate or Senior) COTS Configuration/Development SAS Macro Yes Intermediate SAS Programming Yes Intermediate Big Data Python Yes Intermediate R Yes Intermediate Leadership / Business Skills Analysis Yes Intermediate CIHI Business Understanding Yes Industry Best Practices/ Trends Yes Intermediate Problem-Solving Yes Senior Process Automation Yes Senior Verbal Communication Yes Intermediate Workflow Design Yes Intermediate Written Communication Yes Intermediate Coaching/ Mentoring Yes Intermediate Other G-Confid Yes Intermediate Tau-Argus Yes Intermediate sdcTable Yes Intermediate",hybrid,NaN,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","[{'Seniority level': 'Entry level'}, {'Employment type': 'Contract'}, {'Job function': 'Engineering and Information Technology'}, {'Industries': 'Staffing and Recruiting'}]",2023-04-19,https://ca.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-analyst-at-iq-hunt-ltd-3569910507?refId=XEh4W2IhlQhuNFjAh%2BKZqg%3D%3D&trackingId=cl4oP%2F5lp73hF2MLSMxluw%3D%3D&position=7&pageNum=0&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card
