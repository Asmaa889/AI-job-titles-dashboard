Junior Software Engineer,Acrylic Robotics,"Please Apply Using This Form Only: https://5dd3t7leicc.typeform.com/to/x9FMhaHgWho We Are:At Acrylic, we’re on a mission to build the fine art creation tools of the future and make art accessible to all while making it easier for creators to earn a living. We leverage robotics and machine learning to enable visual artists to produce textured artwork made with real paint on canvas — at scale.Paintings can take weeks to make by hand. To earn a decent living, artists have to charge thousands for each piece. This means artists must often choose between two options: trying to reach the upper-class elite through galleries or undercharging for their work while working a second job to make ends meet. This means the general public is priced out of the art world and artists are limited to a niche audience.We’re on a mission to change that binary. Our technology lets artists make limited-edition painted replicas of original pieces. Artists can have our tech make full reproductions or use it as part of their creative process. They’re able to scale and generate orders of magnitude more profit per design and can make their work accessible to the general public.Getting there means developing a new way to digitize the painting process. Our technology tracks how an artist makes each piece (right now, via digital art creation software on an iPad/drawing tablet), and we train robots to replay each brushstroke using real paint on canvas — a robotic extension of the artist’s hands. Welcome to Acrylic!We’re an early-stage, fast-growing tech startup based in Montreal with deep ties to the entrepreneurial ecosystems in Montreal and Toronto, having been previously accelerated through NEXT Canada’s Next 36 program, NEXT Canada’s Next AI program, Centech (ETS) Acceleration program, the McGill Dobson Centre’s X-1 Accelerator, and the McGill Engine Centre’s TechAccel program. We’re currently incubated within Centech’s 2-year Propulsion program for promising deep tech ventures. We’ve won Centech’s Tech Innovation prize for the company developing tech with the greatest IP & commercial promise and in 2021 were named one of Canada’s ‘Top 10 Startups to Watch’ by GRIT Magazine.Duties and Responsibilities This summer is an exciting time for Acrylic! We’re fresh off of a year of hardcore tech development and we’re gearing up for the launch of our first collections.

We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our first product is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations. We’re now the top-ranked app on the Android Play Store for terms like “itinerary” and “trip planner”, and on Google for terms like “travel planner” and “itinerary planner”. Even during COVID, we’ve seen our userbase grow.Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.We now serve 100,000s of travelers a month, and are a team of 7, including Namphuong, a former Doordash designer; Tuyet (based in Boston), a recent MIT CS graduate; Shine (in Seattle), a recent University of Washington graduate; and Elise and Kermina (based out of Toronto), two University of Toronto 3rd- and 4th-year students spending a full year interning with us!We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow.

"Engineer-In-Training, Data Science",Taseko: Gibraltar Mine,"Company Background and CultureWith headquarters in Vancouver, Canada, Taseko Mines Limited is a leading North American copper producer across a range of key dimensions: operational efficiency; low energy and GHG intensity, environmentally sound, socially responsible development; healthy and safe workplaces and communities.The Company’s foundational asset is the long-life, low-cost Gibraltar copper mine (75% owned) in south-central British Columbia, for which it has won numerous environmental and safety awards for operational excellence. Gibraltar is a state-of-the-art facility and the second largest open pit copper mine in Canada, with a 700+ person workforce. Gibraltar produces an average of 130 million pounds of copper and 2.5 million pounds of molybdenum each year, with mineral reserves sufficient for more than 20 years of future operations.Taseko is also advancing the Florence Copper Project in Arizona – a near-term copper producer with an unparalleled energy, water and GHG profile per unit of production. Florence Copper is a unique ‘in-situ copper recovery’ project which, once operating, will significantly increase Taseko’s copper production. Taseko expects to receive its final federal permit for the Florence Copper Project in 2022, after which construction will commence. The project will have a production capacity of 85 million pounds of copper per year over a 20-year mine life.The Yellowhead Project is a large, long-life copper project that Taseko added to its development portfolio in 2019.

Gibraltar is a state-of-the-art facility and the second largest open pit copper mine in Canada, with a 700+ person workforce. Gibraltar produces an average of 130 million pounds of copper and 2.5 million pounds of molybdenum each year, with mineral reserves sufficient for more than 20 years of future operations.Taseko is also advancing the Florence Copper Project in Arizona – a near-term copper producer with an unparalleled energy, water and GHG profile per unit of production. Florence Copper is a unique ‘in-situ copper recovery’ project which, once operating, will significantly increase Taseko’s copper production. Taseko expects to receive its final federal permit for the Florence Copper Project in 2022, after which construction will commence. The project will have a production capacity of 85 million pounds of copper per year over a 20-year mine life.The Yellowhead Project is a large, long-life copper project that Taseko added to its development portfolio in 2019.
